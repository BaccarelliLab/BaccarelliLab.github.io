title: "DNA methylation GrimAge strongly predicts lifespan and healthspan"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2009-10-01-paper-title-number-1
excerpt: 'Using large scale validation data from thousands of individuals, we demonstrate that DNAm GrimAge stands out among existing epigenetic clocks in terms of its predictive ability for time‐to‐death (Cox regression P=2.0E‐ 75), time‐to‐coronary heart disease (P=6.2E‐24), time‐to‐cancer (P= 1.3E‐12), its strong relationship with computed tomography data for fatty liver/excess visceral fat, and age‐at‐menopause (P=1.6E‐12). AgeAccelGrim is strongly associated with a host of age‐related conditions including comorbidity count (P=3.45E‐17). Similarly, age‐adjusted DNAm PAI‐1 levels are associated with lifespan (P=5.4E‐28), comorbidity count (P= 7.3E‐56) and type 2 diabetes (P=2.0E‐26). These DNAm‐based biomarkers show the expected relationship with lifestyle factors including healthy diet and educational attainment.   Overall, these epigenetic biomarkers are expected to find many applications including human anti‐aging studies.'
