excerpt: 'This paper details a new DNAm-based age (epigenetic age) estimator, GrimAge. These estimators predict lifespan after adjusting for chronological age and other risk factors  Using large scale validation data from thousands of individuals, we demonstrate that DNAm GrimAge stands out among existing epigenetic clocks in terms of its predictive ability for time‐to‐death, time‐to‐coronary heart disease, time‐to‐cancer, its strong relationship with computed tomography data for fatty liver/excess visceral fat, and age‐at‐menopause. These DNAm‐based biomarkers show the expected relationship with lifestyle factors including healthy diet and educational attainment.'
