Mission
======
The laboratory conducts large scale environmental and epidemiology studies to investigate environmental programming and mechanisms of human disease. We use state-of-the-art technologies in epigenetics to identify novel disease mechanisms or molecular records of past environmental exposures and life experiences. We have recently initiated a new area of research into environmental mitochondriomics, dedicated to discovering in mitochondria novel sensors and mediators of environmental effects in mitochondria. The highly dimensional data generated in the lab are handled through advanced approaches in computational epigenomics to analyze the complex relationships between genes and their environment, as well as basic biological and quantitative science.

Many of the features of this GitHub focus on management systems (like Data Management), by providing collaborators access to a cohesive set of templates and protocols for data sharing. 


Thank You!
