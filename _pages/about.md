Mission
======
The laboratory conducts large scale environmental and epidemiology studies to investigate environmental programming and mechanisms of human disease. We use state-of-the-art technologies in epigenetics to identify novel disease mechanisms or molecular records of past environmental exposures and life experiences. We have recently initiated a new area of research into environmental mitochondriomics, dedicated to discovering in mitochondria novel sensors and mediators of environmental effects in mitochondria. The highly dimensional data generated in the lab are handled through advanced approaches in computational epigenomics to analyze the complex relationships between genes and their environment, as well as basic biological and quantitative science.

Many of the features of this GitHub focus on management systems (like Data Management), by providing collaborators access to a cohesive set of templates and protocols for data sharing. 

Getting started
======
1. Register a GitHub account if you don't have one and confirm your e-mail (required!)
1. Fork [this repository](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) by clicking the "fork" button in the top right. 
1. Go to the repository's settings (rightmost item in the tabs that start with "Code", should be below "Unwatch"). Rename the repository "[your GitHub username].github.io", which will also be your website's URL.
1. Set site-wide configuration and create content & metadata (see below -- also see [this set of diffs](http://archive.is/3TPas) showing what files were changed to set up [an example site](https://getorg-testacct.github.io) for a user with the username "getorg-testacct")
1. Upload any files (like PDFs, .zip files, etc.) to the files/ directory. They will appear at https://[your GitHub username].github.io/files/example.pdf.  
1. Check status by going to the repository settings, in the "GitHub pages" section

This template was forked from the [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) created by Michael Rose, and then extended to support the kinds of content that academics have: publications, talks, teaching, a portfolio, blog posts, and a dynamically-generated CV.
