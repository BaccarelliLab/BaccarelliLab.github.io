**[Identity and Access Management](https://aws.amazon.com/iam/)** <br/>
<br>IAM provides lab members with highly configurable AWS service APIs to access resources such as RStudio from an EC2 Instance. IAM is also used to provide collaborators with temporary access to upload and download from S3 buckets for data transfer purposes.

**[Simple Storage Service](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/)** <br/>
<br>S3 is a secure, object-based storage service. S3 provides safe back-up of data, and provides data on-demand through configuraton with EC2 instances.

**[Elastic Block Store](https://aws.amazon.com/ebs/)** <br/>
<br>EBS provides block storage volumes for EC2 instances. Volumes can be restored from Snapshots, also known as  copies of previously configured volumes, and attached to new instances to enable faster environment configuration.
