## Welcome to the Baccarelli Lab Amazon Web Services (AWS) Page

### *Our AWS Set-Up*

--- 
**Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2)** EC2 is a scalable, high-performance cloud computing service. EC2's customized instances provide capacity for faster analysis of large genomic datasets.

---
**Identity and Access Management (IAM)** IAM provides lab members with highly configurable AWS service APIs to access resources such as RStudio from an EC2 Instance. IAM is also used to provide collaborators with temporary access to upload and download from S3 buckets for data transfer purposes.

---
**Simple Storage Service (S3)** S3 is a secure, object-based storage service. S3 provides safe back-up of data, and provides data on-demand when through configuraton with EC2 instances.

---
**CloudBerry** CloudBerry provides secure, highly configurable links for the encrypted transfer of sensitive files. This is particularly useful for the fast, safe sharing of data with our collaborators.
