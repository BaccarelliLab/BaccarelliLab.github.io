## Welcome to the Baccarelli Lab Amazon Web Services (AWS) Page

### *Our AWS Set-Up*

--- 
**Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2)** Scalable, high-performance cloud computing. EC2's customized instances provide the capacity for faster analysis of large genomic datasets.

---
**Identity and Access Management (IAM)** IAM enables lab members highly configurable AWS service APIs to resources, such as RStudio.IAM also provides collaborators temporary access to upload and download from S3 buckets for data transfer purposes.

**Simple Storage Service (S3)** Secure, object-based storage. S3 provides secure data back-up and by using IAM roles for configuration with RStudio, calling S3 buckets and objects from an instance provides easy access to data for analysis.

**CloudBerry** CloudBerry provides secure, highly configurable links for the encrypted transfer of sensitive files. This is particularly useful for the fast, safe sharing of data produced by the lab.
